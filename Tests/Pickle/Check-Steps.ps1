.SYNOPSIS
  Compile every step pattern of this suite, and match every step line of every feature against
  them. No game, about two seconds.

.DESCRIPTION
  Written after a whole run was lost to a pattern that looked right and was not.

  On 2026-09-21 the first WSL pass of this suite played zero scenarios and reported
  `exitReason: infrastructure-error`. The cause was one character class: in a Cucumber Expression,
  parentheses mean OPTIONAL TEXT, so `at ({int}, {int})` is not "a cell" but an optional group
  containing parameters - which is illegal. Pickle refused to build its step table at all, so not
  one scenario of the nineteen ran. The fix is to escape them, `at \({int}, {int}\)`, which in a C#
  literal is written `\\(` and `\\)`.

  An invalid pattern costs the whole run, not the scenario using it, and the machine is shared: a
  lost run is also everybody else's forty minutes in the queue. That is worth two seconds here.

  This checks two things, both against Pickle's own engine rather than against a guess:

    1. Every pattern this suite declares COMPILES, using the same PickleParameterTypeRegistry the
       game uses. This is the check that would have caught the failure above.
    2. Every `Given/When/Then/And` line in every feature either MATCHES one of those patterns or is
       left over for Pickle's own vocabulary. The leftovers are listed so a person can read them
       against the built-in catalogue (Docs/steps.md in the Pickle repository); they are not an
       error here, because this script does not load Pickle's own step assembly.

  It also reports a pattern this suite declares and no feature ever uses. A step nobody calls is
  weight, and the doctrine says to delete it rather than keep it for later.
